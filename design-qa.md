## Findings

No actionable P0, P1, or P2 findings remain.

- Fonts and typography: the implementation uses the existing product sans-serif stack with equivalent weights, readable 15px message copy, and a clear hierarchy matching the selected direction.
- Spacing and layout rhythm: the two-column inbox, full-width state navigation, message reading pane, sticky action bar, and bottom outcome strip match the source hierarchy. Runtime data controls the amount of visible list and message content.
- Colors and visual tokens: near-black surfaces, low-contrast dividers, emerald verification/approval states, cyan send state, and muted secondary copy match the source direction and pass visible contrast checks.
- Image and icon fidelity: the selected visual contains no required raster imagery. The implementation uses the project's existing Lucide icon system, which matches the source icon language; no CSS drawings, handcrafted SVGs, or placeholder assets were introduced.
- Copy and content: U.S. English operational labels use plain language. `Confirmed revenue` is explicitly separated from `Estimated pipeline` and marked `Not collected revenue`.
- Accessibility: landmarks, heading order, button names, disabled send state, form labels, status feedback, and visible keyboard focus are present. Screenshot review does not claim full WCAG compliance.

## Comparison History

1. Initial implementation review found one P2: the three primary action buttons were materially smaller than the selected visual and weakened the approval hierarchy.
2. Fix applied: increased the action controls to 48px height with consistent minimum widths.
3. Post-fix evidence: `design-qa-actions-comparison.png` shows Edit, Approve, and Send with the intended emphasis and disabled-send affordance.

## Primary Interactions Tested

- Select a prospect from the inbox.
- Approve a pending draft and verify it moves to Approved.
- Open Edit, change the subject/body, save, and verify it returns to Needs approval.
- Verify Send is disabled before approval.
- Verify Send becomes enabled after approval.
- Open the send confirmation and cancel it; no email was sent.
- Open Sent and verify the empty state.
- Browser console checked: no client errors.

## Residual P3 Polish

- The local development identity badge remains visible in QA screenshots; production uses the authenticated account identity.
- Runtime list density varies with the number of real drafts and is intentionally not filled with invented activity.

## Post-review preservation check

- The full operational console remains available at `/revenue-engine/advanced` from the clearly labeled “Advanced tools” button.
- No outreach outcome is hidden: contacted stays in Sent, replies/calls in Replies, verified deposits in Sales, and lost opportunities in Closed.
- The simplified inbox can record replies, calls, verified deposits, and lost outcomes without fabricating revenue.

## English localization and outreach-copy pass

- Implementation evidence: `design-qa-english.png` at the existing desktop QA viewport and pending-approval state.
- Full-view comparison: layout, typography, spacing, colors, icons, and action hierarchy remain unchanged from the previously passed source comparison; only product copy and draft content changed.
- Focused copy check: all visible default-inbox labels, statuses, controls, dates, metrics, and the selected outreach draft are in U.S. English.
- The professional outreach version identifies Robert, states a grounded opportunity, explains the proposed value, discloses the project price and 50% deposit, and asks for a specific 15-minute call without inventing business results.
- Primary interaction tested: “Use professional version” populated the revised subject/body and “Save revision” persisted it while returning the draft to approval-required state. No email was sent.
- No P0/P1/P2 visual or content regressions found.

final result: passed
